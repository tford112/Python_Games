'''
Othello is a 2-player strategy game revolving around capturing as many pieces as possible
at the conclusion of the game. Each player chooses either black or white as their color.
To capture a piece, black (white) must flip the opponent's rival color piece to turn it White
(Black). To flip a piece, the player must place his piece around the opponent's piece
so it is in the middle of their own pieces. For example, if the board shows "BW" then black
can play a piece next to W so it becomes "BWB" and so the W is flipped to become "BBB".
